WEATHER APP
A weather app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django allows users to view real-time weather updates for different locations. The front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) provides a user-friendly interface, displaying weather data like temperature, humidity, and forecasts. JavaScript fetches weather information from an API, displaying it dynamically. Django handles the back-end, managing user requests and serving the web pages. The app integrates both the front-end and back-end for a seamless and interactive weather experience.
